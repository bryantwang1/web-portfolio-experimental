        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          Right now I'm studying at a code school called <a href="http://www.epicodus.com">Epicodus</a>. It's quite a change from what I was doing before &mdash; translating Japanese into English (anime and manga and the like) &mdash; but I've always had an affinity for computers. Born in 1990, I missed out on the days of sub-megabyte hard drives and barely missed the glory of Windows 3, as by the time I came of age Microsoft had already moved on to good ol' Win95. Fortunately, my dad was determined to provide computers to each of my siblings, as well as myself; it was a luxury that had seemed out of reach for him back in Taiwan, and now that he was able, he wanted to furnish his family home with all manner of gadgetry.
        </p>
        <p>
          At any rate, since the age of 6 when I got my first desktop, I've been on computers for the vast majority of nearly every day of my life. I grew up enjoying my graphics card with an entire 32MB of vram, and eventually dabbled in graphic design in my last years of high school and first years of college, as well as taking a trimester of basic html way back in 7th grade, and a very poorly designed semester-long programming course built around PLT Scheme in high school (the year after I took it, it was completely overhauled and built around Python...I heard it was much improved but that's the cost of being an early adopter). Despite these encounters with programming languages throughout the years, I didn't really take to them at the time. I'm inclined to blame poor course design and so-so teachers, but I probably hadn't yet developed the patience to work through debugging and figuring out what goes where.

          So, uh, basically I guess my brain development has caught up now and I decided to go to one of these code schools that have been popping up everywhere for the past half decade or so, and here I am.

          <h2>Skills</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>English is my native language, but I majored in Japanese in college and speak (but don't write) some household Chinese.</li>
            <li>Used to be fairly adept at most of the software in Adobe Creative Suite, could probably catch up without <em>too</em> much trouble. </li>
            <li>I understand what f-stops are on a camera, so that's something...</li>
            <li>I can type at around 100-160wpm depending on the keyboard and if I need to use proper punctuation and spelling.</li>
            <li>I practiced seven-star mantis kung fu for about 6 years.</li>

          <h2>Interests/Hobbies</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>As you can guess from my college major, I'm pretty much a <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/weeaboo">Weeb</a>.</li>
            <li>I've started learning German and Italian, but due to inconsistency in studying I've only made so much progress. <em>Note</em>: the languages I have chosen to learn have nothing to do with the WW2 axis powers; the first time I realized that I had chosen the axis languages, I facepalmed.</li>
            <li>I've been a gamer since I first laid paws on a keyboard, currently equipped with a GTX 1070 and about to be playing Battlefield 1 if I have the time.</li>
